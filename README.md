## Reflection

This was one of my more challenging builds. Using multple components and the Context API.   

After struggling to find an API I used dummy data to populate the app. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate.  

One of the main challenges I ran into was wokring out the filter logic. This project also gave me the opportunity to practice React-Router in depth.
